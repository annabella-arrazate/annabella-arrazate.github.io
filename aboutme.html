      <ul>
        <li>I am a part of many afterschool activities, like Marching Band, Robotics, NJROTC, and the Gaming Club.</li>
        <li>I play trumpet!</li>
        <li>I have a a couple dogs, but the ones that hang around me the most are my rottie named Millie and my rednose pitbull mix Luna.</li>
        <li>Even though I love NJROTC, I'm not the best at being firm or giving commands.</li>
        <li>I'm the middle child of my siblings. I have a brother who is 21 and a sister who is 12.</li>
        <li>I've been thinking about what I want to major in lately, and it'll either be at LSU in music education or at Neumont College of Computer Sciences in cybersecurity.</li>
        <li>I'll most likely go into college ROTC and enlist in the Navy if possible.</li>
        <li>I've always loved to write, and am actually just starting a new novel after taking a break for a while.</li>
